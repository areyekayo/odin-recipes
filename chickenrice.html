        <br><br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice in a medium bowl and pour in cold water to cover. Agitate rice with your hands until water is cloudy. Drain and repeat until water is almost clear. Pour in water to cover rice by 2" and let soak for 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pot with a wide base over medium-high. Add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally until golden. Add garlic and cook, stirring until softened about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add chicken, turmeric, cayenne, and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. Cook the chicken, turning and moving as needed, until chicken begins to turn opaque (about 2 minutes). Pour in 3/4 cups of water and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, until chicken is cooked and very tender (about 20 minutes).</li>
            <li>Drain rice and add to pot with chicken, then add coconut milk and remaining 1 tsp salt. Stir to incorproate and bring to a boil. Cover with lid and reduce heat to lowest setting and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and arrange kale in an even layer over the chicken and rice and cover. Let sit until wilted, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide chicken and rice among bowls. Top with chiles if using, and lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
