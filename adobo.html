    <img src="images/adobo.jpg" alt="Chicken stewed in soy sauce, garlic, vinegar, and coconut milkâ€”a traditional Filipino dish.">
    <p>Tangy vinegar, sweet coconut milk, and the umami of soy sauce perfectly balances this alternative take on chicken adobo. Silky, comforting, but with lots of flavor, this is the perfect dish for a rainy day.</p>
